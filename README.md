# Comparative Analysis of Naive Bayes and Neural Network Algorithms for Sentiment Analysis on Amazon E-commerce Reviews

Dataset: [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmudulhaqueshawon/amazon-product-reviews)

In this project, we explore and compare the effectiveness of two prominent machine learning algorithms—Multinomial Naive Bayes and Deep Learning using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)—in the domain of sentiment analysis, specifically applied to customer reviews from Amazon. The primary objective is to determine which algorithm performs better in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall in analyzing sentiments expressed in customer feedback.

The results of our analysis show that the Multinomial Naive Bayes model outperforms its LSTM counterpart, achieving an impressive accuracy, precision, and recall of 90%. This finding underscores the potential of Multinomial Naive Bayes in handling text classification tasks within the context of e-commerce sentiment analysis.

This study not only contributes to the ongoing dialogue on the applicability of traditional versus advanced machine learning techniques in real-world applications but also serves as a valuable reference for stakeholders in the e-commerce industry looking to enhance their customer insights through data analytics.
